/**
 * Utility class for Comparators.
 *
 * getHeightComparator compares Players based on heights
 * getTrueShootingPercentageComparator compares Players based on shooting skills
 *
 * Some background concerning the latter:
 * In basketball, true shooting percentage is an advanced statistic that
 * measures a player's efficiency at shooting the ball. It is intended to more accurately
 * calculate a player's shooting than field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and
 * three-point field goal percentage taken individually. Two- and three-point field goals and
 * free throws are all considered in its calculation. It is abbreviated TS%.
 *
 * TS% = pointsScored / 2 x (fieldGoalAttempts + (0.44 x freeThrowAttempts))
 * Example for a player's first game:
 *  fieldGoalAttempts = 20, freeThrowAttempts = 5, pointsScored = 38 => TS% = 0.8559 = 85.59%
 * Example for the same player's second game:
 *  fieldGoalAttemps = 1, freeThrowAttemps = 0, pointsScored = 3 => trueShootingPercentage = 1.5 = 150%
 *
 * Season average true shooting percentage for this player (two matches):
 * (38 + 3) / 2 x ((20 + 1) + (0.44 x (5 + 0)) = 0.8836 = 88.36%
