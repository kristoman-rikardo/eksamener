     * ID, status, contained products, and any number of
     * {@link no.ntnu.tdt4100.ShipmentUpdate} objects contained within.
     * Each attribute is separated by a semicolon, and each section

     * The generated string is then written to the provided OutputStream.
     *

     *                     are to be written.
