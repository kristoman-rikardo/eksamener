    /**
     * Reads an input stream and produces a result set with a list of unique projects and encountered
     * errors by parsing the stream.
     * The input stream is expected to be a CSV file with the format 
     * as defined in resources/data.csv
     * 
     * Behavioural requirements:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The first line of the file contains header information and should be skipped</li>
     * <li>There might various types of errors in the file, such as missing fields, erronous data etc.</li>
     * <li>If erronous data is encountered (such as empty string), an {@link no.ntnu.tdt4100.part4.LineReadError} 
     * should be added to the result set and the line should be skipped, continuing to read the file from the next line</li>
     * <li>The returned {@link Set} of errors should contain the file line number where the error occured 
     * as key and the Exception message as value</li>
     * <li>There might be duplicates or data in the file, a {@link Set} of unique projects should be returned</li>
     * <li>A projects uniqueness is determined by its {@link no.ntnu.tdt4100.part2.Project#projectId()}</li>
     * <li>If parsed correctly, the returned list should be 294 elements long</li>
     * <li>Each time a duplicate project is encountered, the error message should be "Duplicate project"</li>
     * <li>Some projects have a comma in their names and are quoted with "". 
     * An example of this is seen on line 27 in the data.csv.
     * 
     * There should be no quotes for the project name in the result, 
     * i.e "Programmable motivating,Graphical User Interface" should be Programmable motivating,Graphical User Interface
     * in the result without quotes. You may use the supplied CSV_SPLIT_REGEX to achieve this.
     * 
     * <li>Projects that have commas in their names are quoted with "" in the CSV (example on line 27). 
     * The {@link no.ntnu.tdt4100.part2.Project#name()} in {@link ResultSet} should not contain quotes.
     * You may use the supplied {@link ProjectsReader#CSV_SPLIT_REGEX} to achieve this.</li>
